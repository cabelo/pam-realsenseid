# pam-realsenseid

The su/sudo command in the operating system has the function of scaling administration privileges to the user. In this project, we will see how to increase security by including Realsense ID Facial Biometrics technology together with the password, thus creating an additional layer of authentication ...learn more

## Overview / Usage

This method is more common among human beings recognize one another, we can understand and identify the emotional state of a person just by observing his facial expression.

Static applications and assist (where the image, the lighting environment is controlled and verification) is conducive to accuracy. When the application is unattended or the ambient lighting and image are not controlled, we must increase the coefficient of similarity makes the system demanding, thus obtaining accurate results.

Although facial recognition is a simple task for humans, is extremely complex to implement this process on a machine, because we do not know for sure how the human brain accomplishes this task. The human brain can correctly identify a person from their facial image on even the most diverse conditions such as lighting variations, noting only one of its features or parts, and even with distortion or deformation.

Using the Intel RealSense ID, we can authentication in Linux system with built in anti‑spoofing technology which protects against attacks using photographs, videos or high‑quality 3D masks.

​
## Methodology / Approach

I will use the project developed in 2009 with libpam to authenticate in Linux system. See link about project: https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Pam-face-authentication_project

## Technologies Used
- Realsense ID
